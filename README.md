# 🔴 Live Site
The Live Site aims to be a central information hub for hackers which will contain important information about the hackathon

## 🖼️ big picture
We hope for the Live Site to
- relay important time sensitive information like announcements
- contain a schedule detailing the events happening during a hackathon which can be updated through a CMS
- provide a convenient way to access useful links and resources. e.g.
  - the slack/discord workspace
  - hacker package / slides / prize info
  - devpost
- match hackers and mentors
- be reusable across different hackathons
